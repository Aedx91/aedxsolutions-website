# AedxCorp Website Demo Overview

_Date: 2025-09-24_

## 1. Executive Summary
We built and merged a fully functional multilingual-ready marketing site foundation in a single focused session. Key deliverables:
- Responsive navigation with dedicated mobile drawer (usable, needs polish for production-grade animation & focus trapping refinements).
- Centralized SEO + metadata system with Open Graph, Twitter cards, canonical & hreflang scaffolding.
- Structured data (JSON-LD) for Organization & WebSite on the home page.
- Accessible, progressively enhanced contact form using Next.js Server Actions (spam honeypot + validation).
- Sitemap & robots generation + cleanup of duplication.
- Modern Next.js 15 App Router architecture with React 19 and Turbopack for rapid iteration.

This represents a strong “Demo Stage” baseline: fast to load, crawl-friendly, and extensible for feature growth (analytics, internationalization depth, richer content, CMS integration, etc.).

## 2. Goals Achieved
| Goal | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Mobile navigation | Achieved (baseline) | Drawer works; would benefit from focus trap & gesture polish |
| SEO foundations | Achieved | `seo.ts` centralizes metadata patterns |
| Contact form | Achieved | Server-side validation + user feedback |
| Structured data | Partial | Organization + WebSite on home; product/customer schemas pending |
| Sitemap & robots | Achieved | Single canonical generator retained |
| Accessibility improvements | Achieved (initial) | ARIA states audited; more testing suggested |
| Performance baseline | Implicit | Lightweight bundle; future audits with Lighthouse recommended |

## 3. Architecture Overview
**Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router) with React 19.

**Key Directories:**
- `src/app/[lang]/` – Language-scoped routing foundation (enables future i18n scaling).
- `src/components/` – Reusable UI (e.g., `MobileNav`, `ContactForm`, `SiteNav`).
- `src/lib/seo.ts` – SEO utility functions `pageMeta()` and `alternatesFor()`.
- `scripts/postexport.cjs` – Post-export helper for static asset copying.

**Rendering Strategy:** Primarily static prerendered (SSG) pages; server actions for form handling.

**Metadata & SEO:** Uses Next.js route-level `generateMetadata` functions that delegate to `pageMeta()` for consistency. JSON-LD injected inline via `<script type="application/ld+json">`.

**Contact Form Flow:**
1. User submits form (client).
2. Server Action validates & returns state object.
3. UI renders success or inline error messages (ARIA linked by `aria-describedby`).
4. Honeypot field silently blocks simple bots.

**Mobile Navigation:** Controlled React state toggling a panel overlay. Body scroll locking implemented. Escape key closes panel. (Next iteration: focus trap + inert background.)

## 4. Technology Stack
| Layer | Choice | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| UI Framework | React 19 | Latest concurrent & ergonomics | 
| Meta Framework | Next.js 15 App Router | File-based routing + metadata API |
| Bundler | Turbopack | Fast dev iteration |
| Styling | (Implicit Tailwind 4 ready) | Utility-first (future expansion) |
| Forms | Server Actions + progressive enhancement | Minimal JS surface |
| Testing (installed) | Jest + Testing Library + Playwright | Unit + e2e + a11y potential |
| Animation | Framer Motion (installed) | Can enhance nav & transitions later |

## 5. Key Files Added / Modified
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/components/MobileNav.tsx` | Mobile slide-out navigation |
| `src/components/ContactForm.tsx` | Central accessible contact form component |
| `src/app/[lang]/contact/actions.ts` | Server Action for form post & validation |
| `src/lib/seo.ts` | SEO metadata utility functions |
| `src/app/[lang]/*/page.tsx` | Added `generateMetadata` per page |
| `src/app/sitemap.ts` | Consolidated sitemap generator |

## 6. Accessibility Notes
Implemented: semantic roles, `aria-expanded`, inline error messaging, Escape handling, descriptive labels.
Next: add focus trap to mobile drawer, test with keyboard-only + screen readers, audit heading levels.

## 7. Performance & DX
- Cold build fast via Turbopack.
- First Load JS within reasonable small marketing-site budget (~120 kB shared chunk).
- Future: add image optimization (Next/Image), RUM analytics, Lighthouse CI.

## 8. Demo Stage Definition
This codebase is in a “Demo / Foundation” stage:
- ✅ Stable build and deploy-ready for static hosting or Node runtime.
- ✅ Crawlable & basic SEO hygiene in place.
- ✅ Core interaction (contact form) functioning.
- ⚠️ Needs production hardening (CSP tightening, auth for future admin endpoints, logging pipeline, error boundaries).
- ⚠️ Visual design baseline (could integrate design system or advanced theming).

## 9. Gaps & Recommended Next Steps
| Priority | Recommendation | Reason |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| High | Add focus trap + trap return focus for MobileNav | Accessibility compliance |
| High | Add JSON-LD for Products / or future Case Studies | Rich search results |
| Medium | Implement CSP with nonce/hashes (replace inline JSON-LD if needed) | Security posture |
| Medium | Integrate analytics (e.g., Vercel Web Analytics or Plausible) | Insight & iteration |
| Medium | Add Lighthouse & Playwright a11y checks to CI | Regression prevention |
| Low | Introduce CMS or MDX content model | Marketing scalability |
| Low | Add animation polish using Framer Motion | UX refinement |

## 10. Deployment Considerations
- Edge vs Node: Current features compatible with either; server action requires minimal compute.
- Static Export: Possible, except dynamic server actions require fallback strategy (keep Node runtime if needed).
- Environment Variables: None critical yet—future forms (email/API) will need secrets (use platform secret store).

## 11. Security & Privacy Baseline
- No PII stored yet; form output currently logged (should redirect to email/service if going live).
- Recommend adding a rate limit / captcha if spam increases.

## 12. Testing Roadmap
| Layer | Immediate | Future |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Unit | SEO util tests | Form validation edge cases |
| Integration | Contact submit (happy & error) | Sitemap and robots responses |
| E2E | Mobile nav open/close | Keyboard & screen reader snapshot |

## 13. Maintenance Guidelines
- Keep metadata changes centralized: extend `pageMeta()` rather than per-page manual edits.
- When adding new sections: create page under `[lang]` and wire `generateMetadata` early.
- Prefer Server Actions for simple form posts before reaching for client fetch logic.

## 14. Changelog (Session Scope)
- feat: responsive mobile navigation
- feat: centralized SEO utilities + per-page metadata
- feat: contact form server action with validation
- feat: JSON-LD (Organization + WebSite)
- chore: sitemap consolidation & cleanup
- refactor: navigation links migrated to Next `Link`
- fix: ARIA / lint issues for accessibility compliance

## 15. Next Milestone Proposal
Milestone: "Production Hardening v1"
- A11y polish (focus trap, skip link, color contrast audit)
- JSON-LD expansion
- Analytics + structured logging
- Performance budget + CI automation
- Harden CSP & security headers
